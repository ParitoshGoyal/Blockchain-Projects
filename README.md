# Blockchain-Projects

This repository contains multiple sub-repositories where following R&D have been done on blockchain:
1. Link to : A review on Monero(yet another cryptocurrency): Basically, it involves my understanding of the cryptography and one time ring signatures that are fundamentals behind the uniqueness of the protocol.

2. Implementation of a blockchain data structure(a linked list where pointers are replaced by hash pointers)
3. Some projects done while taking up the course of "Bitcoin and Cryptocurrency Technologies" on coursera.
4. A basic decentralised image sharing app built using ethereum.
